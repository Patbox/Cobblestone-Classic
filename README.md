## Cobblestone-Classic

Cobblestone is a server for Minecraft Classic 0.30. It's written in Typescript and running with Deno!

**This project isn't complete yet and it still lacks some major features**

## Features
- Multiworld support
- Easy to modify - It's written in TypeScript
- Custom plugin support
- Works with Minecraft Classic 0.30 and Minecraft 1.18.2
- Compatible with Mojang, ClassiCube and Betacraft authentication
- Modern Mojang UUID support (for mojang accounts)
- Stores worlds in [ClassicWorld](https://wiki.vg/ClassicWorld_file_format) format
- Uses Deno - no more big `node_modules` folder
- The `core` module works in the browser, so you can integrate it to offer singleplayer in your custom MC Classic web client

## Installation
- Install [Deno](https://deno.land/)
- Download [stable version (source code)](https://github.com/Patbox/Cobblestone-Classic/releases) or [development version](https://github.com/Patbox/Cobblestone-Classic/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
- Copy the `server` folder & `run.*` files to a new folder
- Start `run.bat` on Windows or `run.sh` on Linux
